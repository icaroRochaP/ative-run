## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information

Based on the existing project architecture, the admin panel should integrate seamlessly:

**Key Directories to Leverage:**
- `app/` - Next.js App Router (create `app/admin/` subdirectory)
- `components/` - Reusable components (create `components/admin/` subdirectory)
- `components/ui/` - Existing UI components (Table, Card, Button, Modal, etc.)
- `types/` - TypeScript interfaces (create `types/admin.ts`)
- `lib/` - Utilities and data (create admin-specific utilities)

**Existing Design System to Leverage:**
- **Colors**: Use existing Aleen brand colors from `tailwind.config.ts`
  - Primary: `aleen-primary` (#009929)
  - Secondary: `aleen-secondary` (#27a3df)
  - Light: `aleen-light` (#fffff0)
  - Purple: `aleen-purple` (#8812f1)
- **Typography**: Plus Jakarta Sans already configured
- **Components**: Reuse all existing UI components
  - Table component for data display
  - Card components for dashboard layout
  - Button component with existing variants
  - Modal components for edit/create/confirm dialogs

**Database Schema Integration:**
Based on `database.types.ts`, the following tables are available:
- **users table**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `onboarding`, `new_account`, `created_at`
- **agents table**: `id`, `name`, `description`, `prompt`, `identifier`, `created_at`
- **leads table**: For future lead management (not in scope)

**Supabase MCP Integration:**
- Use `mcp_supabase_execute_sql` for agents CRUD operations
- Use `mcp_supabase_list_tables` to verify table structure
- Implement real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
- Handle error states and loading for all MCP operations

**Authentication and Security:**
- Leverage existing `AuthGuard` pattern for admin access
- Create `AdminGuard` component following same pattern as `AuthGuard`
- Use existing authentication context and user management
- Future: Backend validation for admin role (not in current scope)

**Component Architecture Patterns:**
Follow existing patterns from dashboard components:
- Card-based layouts like `DashboardLayout.tsx`
- Tab navigation similar to dashboard tabs
- Modal patterns from existing modals
- Table patterns from existing workout/meal displays
- Loading states and error handling patterns

**Routing Structure:**
```
/admin - Main admin dashboard
/admin/users - Users management
/admin/agents - AI agents management
```

**Responsive Design Strategy:**
- Follow existing mobile-first approach
- Use same breakpoints as dashboard: `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`
- Implement table responsive patterns (stack on mobile, scroll on tablet)
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography scales

**Mock Data Structure:**
Create realistic mock data for development:
- **Users**: 50+ mock users with varied subscription statuses
- **Metrics**: Subscription counts, revenue figures, growth trends
- **Agents**: Include existing agents from database plus additional mock agents

**Performance Considerations:**
- Implement pagination for large datasets (25-50 items per page)
- Use React.memo for expensive table renders
- Implement virtual scrolling for very large tables (future enhancement)
- Lazy load admin sections to reduce initial bundle size

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Toast notifications for success/error states
- Inline validation for forms
- Graceful degradation for network issues
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Manual testing across all device sizes
- Supabase MCP integration testing
- Form validation testing
- Responsive behavior verification
- Accessibility testing with keyboard navigation

**Test File Location:**
- Create test files in `__tests__/components/admin/` if unit tests needed
- Manual testing checklist for admin functionality
- Integration testing for Supabase MCP operations

**Testing Requirements:**
- Verify all CRUD operations work correctly
- Test responsive behavior at all breakpoints
- Validate form inputs and error handling
- Check loading states and user feedback
- Ensure admin access restrictions work properly
- Test confirmation dialogs and destructive actions

**Admin Access Testing:**
- Test admin route protection
- Verify proper redirects for non-admin users
- Test logout functionality
- Validate session management
