## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information

Based on the existing project structure, the landing page should integrate seamlessly with the current architecture:

**Key Directories:**
- `app/` - Next.js App Router (create `app/landing/page.tsx`)
- `components/` - Reusable components (create `components/landing/` subdirectory)
- `components/ui/` - Existing UI components to leverage (Button, Card, etc.)
- `public/` - Static assets (aleen-logo.png, placeholder images)

**Existing Design System to Leverage:**
- **Colors**: Aleen brand colors already defined in `tailwind.config.ts`
  - Primary: `aleen-primary` (#009929)
  - Secondary: `aleen-secondary` (#27a3df)
  - Light: `aleen-light` (#fffff0)
  - Purple: `aleen-purple` (#8812f1)
- **Typography**: Plus Jakarta Sans already imported in `globals.css`
- **Components**: Reuse existing components from `components/ui/`
  - Button component with proper variants
  - Card components for feature sections
  - Existing responsive patterns

**WhatsApp Integration:**
- CTAs should use `https://wa.me/` links with pre-filled message
- Example: `https://wa.me/5511999999999?text=Hi%20Aleen,%20I%20want%20to%20start%20my%20AI%20fitness%20journey!`
- Replace phone number with actual Aleen.ai WhatsApp number

**Routing:**
- Landing page should be accessible at `/landing` route
- Consider if this should be the main `/` route or separate
- Ensure proper navigation from dashboard if needed

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Mobile-first approach given target audience

**Content Guidelines:**
- All content must be in English
- Professional, confident tone showcasing AI capabilities
- Clear, benefit-focused messaging
- Avoid technical jargon, focus on user benefits
- Emphasize convenience, personalization, and results

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
Use existing Tailwind breakpoints:
- Mobile: Default (up to 640px)
- Tablet: `md:` (768px+)
- Desktop: `lg:` (1024px+)
- Wide: `xl:` (1280px+)

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Manual testing across all device sizes
- WhatsApp link functionality testing
- Performance testing with Lighthouse
- Accessibility testing for WCAG compliance
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

**Test File Location:**
- Create test files in `__tests__/components/landing/` if unit tests needed
- Manual testing checklist for responsive behavior
- User journey testing from landing to WhatsApp

**Testing Requirements:**
- Verify all CTAs work correctly
- Test responsive behavior at all breakpoints
- Validate WhatsApp links open correctly on different devices
- Check loading performance and Core Web Vitals
- Ensure brand consistency across all components
